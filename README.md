# Python Data Analysis Project Series

This repository is part of my ongoing effort to develop and refine my skills in Python and data analysis. It includes four end-to-end mini projects, each focused on a different dataset and analytical objective.
Each project reflects a stage in my growth, showing my progression from foundational data cleaning to analyzing real datasets, visualizing trends, and presenting insights in a clear and meaningful way.

## 🔹 [Project 1](https://github.com/marissawyl/Python_Projects/tree/main/Project_1): Exploring the 2023 U.S. Data Job Market

Analyzed job postings from the United States to uncover demand, salary, and skill trends across data roles.  
**Focus:** Skill demand, salary comparison, and role-specific insights.  
**Key tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔹 [Project 2](https://github.com/marissawyl/Python_Projects/tree/main/Project_2): Deep Dive into India’s 2024 Job Market

Expanded the previous analysis using a 2024 dataset from Luke Barousse to explore how demand and pay vary across roles and skills in India.  
**Focus:** Skill importance, salary vs. demand analysis, and identifying optimal skill combinations.  
**Key tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔹 [Project 3](https://github.com/marissawyl/Python_Projects/tree/main/Project_3): Understanding Uber Trip Patterns in NYC (2014–2015)

Shifted focus from job data to transportation analytics using Uber trip data from New York City. Explored temporal and spatial trends to understand travel behavior.  
**Focus:** Time-based trends, trip density, and data wrangling.  
**Key tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔹 [Project 4](https://github.com/marissawyl/Python_Projects/tree/main/Project_4): Bitcoin Price Trends (2013–2017)

Analyzed Bitcoin’s price history to visualize its growth, volatility, and market behavior during its early years.  
**Focus:** Time series analysis and interactive visualizations.  
**Key tools:** Python (Plotly, Pandas), Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧩 Tools and Environment

- **Language:** Python
- **Core Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
